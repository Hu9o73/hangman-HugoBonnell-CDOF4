# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game project! This is a classic implementation of the Hangman word-guessing game written in Python. The game randomly selects a word, and the player must guess it letter by letter before the hangman is fully drawn.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection:** Words are chosen randomly from a predefined list of animals.
- **Dynamic Hangman Graphics:** Each incorrect guess reveals a new stage of the hangman.
- **Progress Tracking:** Display of correctly guessed letters and tested (incorrect) letters.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can guess letters and receive feedback in real-time.

## How to Play

1) Run the program in a Python environment.
2) The game will randomly select a word and display underscores for unguessed letters.
3) Enter a letter to guess.
    - Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.
    - Incorrect guesses add to the hangman drawing and display the tested letter.
4) Win the game by guessing the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
    - If you lose, the word will be revealed, and you can start a new game.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
python C:/{Path-to-folder}/hangman

The `python C:/...` function will call the `__main__.py` file inside of the repo, itself launching the game.
